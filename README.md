This project was conceived as a full-stack, SPA demonstrating CRUD operations with JavaScript and 
Firebase.  It was built using JavaScript with React, Redux and SCSS for the front end and connecting 
to a Firebase back end.

The application is designed to manage the process of applying for jobs.  The database is secured to a 
particular user with email-based user account creation and sign-in required.  Information about a 
particular position is entered in a tabbed form and saved to the Firebase persistence layer, with this 
data presented in a sortable table.  Functionality has also been added to manage and delete user accounts.
